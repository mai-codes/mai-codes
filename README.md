## Hi there, I'm Maissoun ðŸ‘‹

I'm Maissoun Ksara (a.k.a. mai-codes). Welcome to my github page!

I have a B.S and M.S in Structural Engineering from Drexel University and I currently work full-time at an engineering company. However, I am extremely passionate about programming and computer science! 
I have been exposed to programming at a young age (thanks, Dad), took AP Computer Science in high school,
and worked on several coding projects in college. 

Throughout this past year, I have taken online courses on edX, Coursera, and Udemy (you can find those on my repositories) to further my computer science skills. I hope to continue learning and one day become a software engineer :grimacing:
